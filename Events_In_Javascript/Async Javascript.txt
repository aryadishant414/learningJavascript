* Sync (Synchronous Javascript) => BLOCK the flow of the Program. mtlb ki agle program ko execute hone ke liye wait krna padega
 previous program ke complete hone ka. 

* Async (Asynchronous Javascript) => Does NOT BLOCK the program execution. mtlb ki agr koi ekk program ko execute hone mai thora

 wait for previous programs to complete.
